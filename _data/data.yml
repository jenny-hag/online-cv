      - role: Pastry chef
        time: 1983 - 2020
        company: Horns CafÃ©, Sweden
        details: |
          As a pastry chef, I often manufacture products based on customer requests.
          It could be, for example, wedding cakes specially designed pastries or a 
          special kind of chocolate praline that the customer wants. In the profession,
          it is good to be creative and have a feeling for the aesthetic as well as a 
          good idea of how flavors and ingredients can be combined.
            - The best thing about the job was getting to work very practically,
            to learn by doing."
